## ✍️ About Me

I'm ## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Samarjit — a passionate and self-driven Frontend Developer focused on crafting engaging and accessible user experiences through clean, scalable code and thoughtful design.

I believe in **learning by building**, and this repository reflects that philosophy. Every project here is a step forward in mastering the art of web development — not just in terms of technical skills, but in problem-solving, attention to detail, and bringing ideas to life on the browser.

I'm committed to continuous growth, open collaboration, and building things that are not only functional but also enjoyable to use.

Whether it's prototyping a layout, improving interactivity, or ensuring responsiveness across devices — I approach every challenge with curiosity, clarity, and care.

> 🚀 I build with purpose, learn in public, and aim to contribute meaningfully to the web.

Let’s build the future, one interface at a time.
